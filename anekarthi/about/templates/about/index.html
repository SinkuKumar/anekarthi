    <h1>About Anekarthi</h1>
    <h2>Why the Name "Anekarthi"?</h2>
    <p>
        The word <b>"Anekarthi"</b> is derived from Hindi, and it beautifully encapsulates the essence of our platform.
        "Anekarthi" translates to <b>"multiple meanings,"</b> reflecting the richness and diversity inherent in
        language, ideas, and perspectives. Just like a single word can carry various interpretations depending on
        context, our website aims to be a multifaceted space where different viewpoints, ideas, and interpretations come
        together.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        At Anekarthi, we believe that every concept, story, or piece of information can be seen through multiple lenses.
        Our mission is to embrace this diversity and provide a platform where various perspectives are not just
        acknowledged but celebrated. Whether it's through articles, discussions, or interactive content, we aim to
